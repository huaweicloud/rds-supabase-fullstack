| Skill | Upstream package | Derivation |
|---|---|---|
| `skills/huaweicloud-supabase/rds-supabase-usage` | `skills/supabase` | Rewritten for the Huawei Cloud RDS Supabase deployment: CLI/Management-API/cloud-dashboard touchpoints removed or replaced with the self-hosted MCP server; schema changes routed through the init.sql single-transaction workflow; serverless compute routed to Huawei Cloud FunctionGraph; security checklist adapted to the deployment (JWT-claims identity, static service_role key). |
| `skills/huaweicloud-supabase/rds-supabase-postgres-best-practices` | `skills/supabase-postgres-best-practices` | Rule bodies largely verbatim (the library targets "Postgres running anywhere"); 9 reference links re-pointed to postgresql.org/pgbouncer.org; 5 rules rewritten where they relied on standard-stack helpers (`auth.uid()`) or cloud conventions (Supavisor ports, one-click extensions); 3 new `rds-` rules added for deployment-specific concerns. |
| `skills/huaweicloud-supabase/rds-supabase-mcp` | — | Original content (server management skill). |
